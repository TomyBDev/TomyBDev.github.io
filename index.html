           <p class="aboutblocktext">I live in Dundee, graduating last summer from Abertay University with a Bachelor of Science (Hons.) degree in Computer Game Technology (2.i).  Since then I have worked as a Graduate Business Analyst in the Oil and Gas Industry, but am really keen to pursue my dream career in game programming.  I am extremely hardworking, dedicated and focused.  I have a polite and friendly manner and have been praised during university team projects for my leadership, team working, coaching and interpersonal skills. I have over 5 years’ experience and knowledge in C++ and have been using Unreal Engine 4 and 5 for over 3 years’ now.</p>
